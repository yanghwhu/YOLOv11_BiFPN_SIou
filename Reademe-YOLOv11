YOLOv11_BiFPN_SIou
This repository contains the implementation of the paper titled "Deep learning to detect stone burial sites from drone
image in the southern foothills of the Tianshan Mountains in Xinjiang, China". The project integrated YOLOv11 with a
Bidirectional Feature Pyramid Network (BiFPN) and improved the loss function to enhance the accuracy of detecting
stone burial sites in drone imagery.
